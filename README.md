# Louisville 2018 Rainfall

## Question and Methods
The question at the heart of this project is "Was 2018 an exceptional year for rainfall in Louisville, KY?" To answer this question, I will
determine this by applying a few basic staticial methods if Louisville's 2018 total rainfall is an outlier against all historical data for 
Louisville, KY's rainfall from the [National Weather Service- Now] (https://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=lmk). I obtained all the monthly data, and then calculated the yearly sums of monthly rainfall, and then had to omit 2 years(1872 & 1946) of data since there were months with missing data. To visually display these methods after cleaning up the data, I have plotted a column plot, a scatterplot, a boxplot,and a histogram with the probability distribution function(bell curve) overlaid.
