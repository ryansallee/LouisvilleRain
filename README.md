# Louisville 2018 Rainfall

## Question
The question at the heart of this project is "Was 2018 an exceptional year for rainfall in Louisville, KY?" To answer this question, we will
determine this by applying a few basic staticial methods if Louisville's 2018 total rainfall is an outlier against all historical data for 
Louisville, KY's rainfall from the [National Weather Service- Now] (https://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=lmk). With these methods,
we have plotted a column plot, a scatterplot, a boxplot,and a histogram with the probability distrobution function(bell curve) overlaid.
